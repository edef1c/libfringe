# libfringe

  libfringe is a low-level green threading library for Rust.
  It's usable in freestanding environments (like kernels),
  but it can also provide an easy-to-use stack allocator using
  your operating system's memory mapping facility.

## Performance

  libfringe does context switches in 2.5ns flat on x86_64!
```
test swap ... bench:         5 ns/iter (+/- 1)
```

  â€¦and on x86:

```
test swap ... bench:         5 ns/iter (+/- 1)
```

## Limitations

  libfringe currently doesn't work on anything but x86 and x86_64,
  and is untested on anything but Linux.

## Installation

  libfringe is a [Cargo](https://crates.io) package.
  It's not stable software yet, so you'll have to use it as a git dependency.
  Add this to your `Cargo.toml`:
```toml
[dependencies.fringe]
git = "https://github.com/nathan7/libfringe.git"
```
