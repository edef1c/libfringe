//! libfringe is a library implementing safe, lightweight context switches,
//! without relying on kernel services. It can be used in hosted environments
//! (using `std`) as well as on bare metal (using `core`).
//!
//! It provides the following safe abstractions:
//!
//!   * an implementation of internal iterators, also known as generators,
//!     [Generator](generator/struct.Generator.html).
//!
//! It also provides the necessary low-level building blocks:
//!
//!   * a trait that can be implemented by stack allocators,
//!     [Stack](struct.Stack.html);
//!   * a stack allocator based on anonymous memory mappings with guard pages,
//!     [OsStack](struct.OsStack.html).
