// To understand the machine code in this file, keep in mind these facts:
// * OR1K C ABI has a "red zone": 128 bytes under the top of the stack
//   that is defined to be unmolested by signal handlers, interrupts, etc.
//   Leaf functions can use the red zone without adjusting r1 or r2.
// * OR1K C ABI passes the first argument in r3. We also use r3 to pass a value
//   while swapping context; this is an arbitrary choice
//   (we clobber all registers and could use any of them) but this allows us
//   to reuse the swap function to perform the initial call. We do the same
//   thing with r4 to pass the stack pointer to the new context.
//
// To understand the DWARF CFI code in this file, keep in mind these facts:
// * CFI is "call frame information"; a set of instructions to a debugger or
//   an unwinder that allow it to simulate returning from functions. This implies
//   restoring every register to its pre-call state, as well as the stack pointer.
// * CFA is "call frame address"; the value of stack pointer right before the call
//   instruction in the caller. Everything strictly below CFA (and inclusive until
//   the next CFA) is the call frame of the callee. This implies that the return
//   address is the part of callee's call frame.
// * Logically, DWARF CFI is a table where rows are instruction pointer values and
//   columns describe where registers are spilled (mostly using expressions that
//   compute a memory location as CFA+n). A .cfi_offset pseudoinstruction changes
//   the state of a column for all IP numerically larger than the one it's placed
//   after. A .cfi_def_* pseudoinstruction changes the CFA value similarly.
// * Simulating return is as easy as restoring register values from the CFI table
//   and then setting stack pointer to CFA.
//
// A high-level overview of the function of the trampolines when unwinding is:
// * The 2nd init trampoline puts a controlled value (written in swap to `new_cfa`)
//   into r2. This is then used as the CFA for the 1st trampoline.
// * This controlled value points to the bottom of the stack of the parent context,
//   which holds the saved r2 and r9 from the call to swap().
// * The 1st init trampoline tells the unwinder to restore r2 and r9
//   from the stack frame at r2 (in the parent stack), thus continuing
//   unwinding at the swap call site instead of falling off the end of context stack.
