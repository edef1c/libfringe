//! To understand the code in this file, keep in mind these two facts:
//! * x86_64 SysV C ABI has a "red zone": 128 bytes under the top of the stack
//!   that is defined to be unmolested by signal handlers, interrupts, etc.
//!   Leaf functions can use the red zone without adjusting rsp or rbp.
//! * x86_64 SysV C ABI requires the stack to be aligned at function entry,
//!   so that (%rsp+8) is a multiple of 16. Aligned operands are a requirement
//!   of SIMD instructions, and making this the responsibility of the caller
//!   avoids having to maintain a frame pointer, which is necessary when
//!   a function has to realign the stack from an unknown state.
//! * x86_64 SysV C ABI passes the first argument in %rdi. We also use %rdi
//!   to pass a value while swapping context; this is an arbitrary choice
//!   (we clobber all registers and could use any of them) but this allows us
//!   to reuse the swap function to perform the initial call.
