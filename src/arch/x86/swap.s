  // save the old stack pointer
  movl %esp, (%ebx)
  // switch to the new stack pointer
  movl %edx, %esp

  // jump into the new context (return to the call point)
  // doing this instead of a straight `ret` is 8ns slower,
  // presumably because the branch predictor tries to be clever about it
  popl %eax
