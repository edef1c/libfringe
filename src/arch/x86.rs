//! To understand the code in this file, keep in mind this fact:
//! * i686 SysV C ABI requires the stack to be aligned at function entry,
//!   so that `%esp+4` is a multiple of 16. Aligned operands are a requirement
//!   of SIMD instructions, and making this the responsibility of the caller
//!   avoids having to maintain a frame pointer, which is necessary when
//!   a function has to realign the stack from an unknown state.
//! * i686 SysV C ABI passes the first argument on the stack. This is
//!   unfortunate, because unlike every other architecture we can't reuse
//!   `swap` for the initial call, and so we use a trampoline.
